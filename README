RPM macros to control the build arch's available for
Fedora Haskell packages with ghc-rpm-macros.

%ghc_arches_with_ghci:

The ghci interactive environment is needed when compiling
packages that use Template Haskell.  It is not available
on all archs.  Use "ExclusiveArch: %{ghc_arches_with_ghci}"
in packages that need the ghci capability to build,
or require a dependency that can only build with ghci.

%ghc_arches:

Deprecated but still used in older releases/packages.
Currently (as of F21) ghc is available on all actively
maintained architectures, but we could use %ghc_arches
again in the future if that is no longer true again.

Please report any issues in Red Hat bugzilla under
the Fedora product and ghc-srpm-macros component.
